<h2>Files With Purpose:</h2>
The file containing the final assignment code in MATLAB is pushed as fano_algorithm which is a .m extension file.The file has been commented and 
description regarding each variable and the various segments of the code have been commented.
The entire code has been divided into 4 parts:
<ol>
<li> Encoding the dataword into a codeword.
<li>Generation of errors into the transmitted codeword. This simulates the effect of noise on codeword.
<li>Decoding and correcting the codeword with error to obtain dataword using Fano algorithm.
</ol>
The first section (1) deals with encoding the dataword with a simulated (2,1,5) encoder. The generator functions are :
<br>g(1) = 111010
<br>g(2) = 111101 

The second section (2) deals with generation of errors into the encoded message and passing those errored message to the section 3 of the code.

The third section (3) implements the Fano algorithm using a recursive logic on the generated transition table in step(1) by recursively 
backtracking paths when threshold is crossed until all the bits in the codeword are exhausted with path metric <= threshold.

<h2>Flow of files during execution:</h2>

The entire project is enclosed in a single matlab file that is fano_algorithm.m.

<h2>Parameters during execution:</h2>


The program offers a menu driven program with two options namely:
<ol type = '1'>
         <li>The user enters an 8 bit dataword and selects positions of the encoded words to generate the errors(complement the bits). The system does the changes to the encoded word, executes the Fano algorithm on this codeword and then displays the corrected codeword generated by the algorithm. The system displays a message that specifies whether the algorithm is successful or not in correcting the codeword and the Hamming distance between the actual codeword and the corrected codeword which is specified under the error variable.
            <li>The user enters an 8 bit dataword and the system uses the algorithm to:
<ol type = 'i'>
                    <li>generate all error limit number of errors which is specified as a global variable.
                    <li>plots graphs for error correction and detection percentage for those generated errors in the step (i) for all threshold values from 2 to threshold limit where threshold limit is global variable. By default, the value of the threshold variable is set to 5. 
</ol>
</ol>
The objective of the assignment solution is to demonstrate a study of the choice of threshold values for any given chunk of dataword.
  The idea proposed is to use the current algorithm from the senders side to observe and analyze the best suitable threshold value to be send 
  to the receiver which allows maximum error correction and detection to be made possible.
  Hence , a possible solution is to send the optimum threshold also with each chunk of dataword to the receiver so that the receiver can 
  decode the received codeword with those threshold values to correct maximum bits of errors.
